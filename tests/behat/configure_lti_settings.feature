@report @report_allylti
Feature: Configure LTI settings for Ally report launches
  In order to be able to launch the Ally reports
  As an Administrator
  I want to be able to configure the settings for those LTI launches

  Scenario: Administrator can configure the settings for the Admin Report LTI launch
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Ally" in site administration
    And I set the field "Launch URL" to "http://locallaunch.dev"
    And I set the field "Key" to "ltikey"
    And I set the field "Secret" to "secretpassword12345"
    And I press "Save changes"
    Then I should see "Changes saved"
