Feature: Accessibility report should not be available to users that don't have Ally configured
  and should be available to users that do have it configured.

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:

  Scenario: Administrator should see Accessibility report after setting up Ally in the site.
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Ally" in site administration
    And I set the field "Launch URL" to "http://locallaunch.dev"
    And I set the field "Key" to "ltikey"
    And I set the field "Secret" to "secretpassword12345"
    And I press "Save changes"
    Then I should see "Changes saved"
    Then I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I navigate to "Reports" in current page administration
