Feature: Launch to Ally reports
  In order to view Ally reports
  As an Administrator
  I want to click a link to launch to Ally reports

  @javascript
  Scenario: Administrator can click a link to launch report when configured
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Admin tools > Ally" in site administration
    And I set the field "Launch URL" to local url "/report/allylti/tests/fixtures/report.php"
    And I set the field "Key" to "ltikey"
    And I click on "Click to enter text" "link"
    And I set the field "Secret" to "secretpassword12345"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I navigate to "Reports > Accessibility" in site administration
    And I switch to "contentframe" iframe
    Then I should see "This represents a report launch"

  Scenario: Teacher does not see a link for the report
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | teacher1 | Terry1    | Teacher1 | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:

      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
